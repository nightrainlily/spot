# turntable: Record Store's algorithmic recommendation system
When I started writing [Record Store](https://recordstore.substack.com/) I was interested in providing human curation of music in the face of so much technology in the music space. As a writer and musician, I brought my avid music cataloging to the table, and people responded to the inexplicable human touch of a curated playlist.
What most people don't know is that I'm also a **Data Scientist** with a love for visualization, trend spotting, and tech. After **graduating from UC Berkeley in 2023**, I couldn't figure out how to combine my interests in human curation and algorithms, which seemed to be totally opposed. Finally, I came up with the idea for ***turntable***, a Record Store recommendation service powered by machine learning.
I started Record Store with the intention of introducing people to new music. I can only write so much every week, and the writing is only a conduit for someone trying to hear more of what they like from me. With turntable, you can get recommendations from my personal library.

## Here's how it works:
It's pretty simple right now: run the ml.ipynb notebook. input a playlist of mine you like. You can find those [here](https://open.spotify.com/user/nightrainlily?si=d3aa5399dddf4b1e).
The code will spit out a similar playlist for you to try.
